Trading Engine in Java

In this project, I have created a basic trading engine in Java that functions as a normal trading platform such as Coinbase for example. I have created an orderbook that maintains and stores a list of buy and sell orders at specific prices and amounts and I have created a function to efficiently match buy and sell limit orders. As I continue to update this repository, I want to be able to create actual users that can trade amongst each other. Another future idea for this project is to give it a front end in HTML/CSS to make it easier for others to try out this application in their browser.
